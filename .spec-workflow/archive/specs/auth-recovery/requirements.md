# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature restores and enhances the authentication system for the litigation support application after a catastrophic code loss. The system needs to implement protected routes across the entire application, ensuring users see only the login screen unless authenticated. The implementation will reconnect existing Next-Auth frontend configuration with the FastAPI backend authentication system and ensure Google OAuth integration works properly.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature is critical infrastructure that supports all user interactions with the application. A robust authentication system ensures data security, user privacy, and proper access control - fundamental requirements for a litigation support system handling sensitive legal documents and information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Protected Route Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all routes protected by authentication, so that unauthorized users cannot access any part of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any route without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
2. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL display only the login page
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to login with appropriate messaging
4. IF a user attempts to access protected API endpoints without valid tokens THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized
5. WHEN authentication middleware is active THEN the system SHALL validate tokens on every protected route

### Requirement 2: Next-Auth and FastAPI Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in once and have my session persist across the application, so that I can work without repeated authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in with credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate against the FastAPI backend
2. IF authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create both access and refresh tokens
3. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it using the refresh token
4. IF the refresh token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL redirect to login
5. WHEN tokens are refreshed THEN the system SHALL update user data from the backend

### Requirement 3: Google OAuth Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with my Google account, so that I can access the application without managing another password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Sign in with Google" THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth flow
2. IF Google authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create or link the user account in the backend
3. WHEN an OAuth user logs in for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a verified account automatically
4. IF an OAuth account exists with the same email THEN the system SHALL link the accounts
5. WHEN OAuth login completes THEN the system SHALL issue the same tokens as credential login

### Requirement 4: Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to persist appropriately and be manageable, so that I have a secure and convenient experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL store JWT tokens securely
2. IF a user logs out THEN the system SHALL revoke all refresh tokens on the backend
3. WHEN session data changes THEN the system SHALL update the client-side session
4. IF multiple tabs are open THEN the system SHALL synchronize authentication state
5. WHEN tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL use httpOnly cookies or secure storage

### Requirement 5: Authentication State Visibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my authentication status and user information, so that I know I'm logged in correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display user information in the UI
2. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages
3. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading states
4. IF a user is logged out THEN the system SHALL clear all user data from the UI
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable feedback

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Authentication logic separated into dedicated modules (auth.ts, middleware.ts, providers)
- **Modular Design**: Reusable authentication hooks, components, and utilities
- **Dependency Management**: Clear separation between Next-Auth configuration and application logic
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined contracts between frontend auth and backend API

### Performance
- Token refresh should complete within 500ms
- Authentication checks should not add more than 50ms to route navigation
- Session validation should be cached appropriately to minimize backend calls
- OAuth flow should complete within 5 seconds under normal conditions

### Security
- All tokens must be transmitted over HTTPS in production
- Refresh tokens must be securely stored and rotated on use
- Password hashes must use bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- Session tokens must have appropriate expiration times (15 min access, 7 days refresh)
- OAuth state parameters must be validated to prevent CSRF attacks

### Reliability
- Authentication system must handle backend unavailability gracefully
- Token refresh must retry with exponential backoff on failure
- System must handle concurrent authentication requests correctly
- OAuth provider outages must not crash the application

### Usability
- Login form must be accessible and support password managers
- Error messages must be clear and actionable
- Loading states must be visible during authentication
- Session timeout warnings should appear before expiration
- OAuth login must be clearly labeled and easy to find
