# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will provide self-represented litigants with the ability to connect and manage multiple Google Gmail/Workspace email accounts through the user profile page. The system will enable secure OAuth-based connections to additional email accounts beyond the primary authentication account, allowing users to collect evidence from multiple email sources (personal, work, family member accounts with permission) in a single litigation support platform.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports several key product objectives:
- **Democratize Legal Tools**: Provides enterprise-level multi-account email access typically only available to law firms
- **Improve Case Outcomes**: Enables comprehensive evidence collection from all relevant email sources
- **Ensure Privacy Protection**: Maintains user control over which accounts to connect and what data to access
- **Lower Barriers to Justice**: Simplifies the complex process of gathering evidence from multiple email accounts

The feature aligns with the product principle of "Accessibility First" by providing guided workflows for non-technical users to securely connect multiple email accounts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a self-represented litigant, I want to connect multiple Gmail/Workspace accounts from my profile page, so that I can collect evidence from all my relevant email sources (personal, work, shared accounts) in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user navigates to the profile page THEN system SHALL display a dedicated "Email Account Connections" section
2. WHEN user clicks "Add Email Account" THEN system SHALL initiate Google OAuth flow for additional account
3. WHEN OAuth flow completes successfully THEN system SHALL store the connection credentials securely
4. WHEN user views connected accounts THEN system SHALL display account email, connection status, and last sync time
5. WHEN user has multiple accounts connected THEN system SHALL allow evidence collection from any connected account

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a self-represented litigant, I want to manage my connected email accounts (view, disconnect, reconnect), so that I can maintain control over which accounts the system can access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user views connected accounts THEN system SHALL display connection status (active, expired, error)
2. WHEN user clicks "Disconnect Account" THEN system SHALL revoke access tokens and remove the connection
3. WHEN OAuth token expires THEN system SHALL display clear reconnection instructions
4. WHEN user clicks "Reconnect Account" THEN system SHALL initiate re-authorization flow
5. IF reconnection fails THEN system SHALL provide clear error messaging and troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a self-represented litigant, I want clear guidance on email account permissions and data access, so that I understand what the system can and cannot access from each connected account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user begins account connection THEN system SHALL display clear explanation of requested permissions
2. WHEN user connects account THEN system SHALL show exactly which data will be accessed (emails, attachments, metadata)
3. WHEN user views account details THEN system SHALL display current permission scope and usage
4. WHEN user disconnects account THEN system SHALL explain what data will be retained vs removed
5. WHEN system encounters permission issues THEN system SHALL provide clear guidance on resolving access problems

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a self-represented litigant, I want the email collection process to work seamlessly with multiple connected accounts, so that I can gather evidence from all relevant sources without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user initiates email harvesting THEN system SHALL present all connected accounts as source options
2. WHEN user selects accounts for harvesting THEN system SHALL process each account according to user-specified criteria
3. WHEN harvesting from multiple accounts THEN system SHALL clearly identify source account for each collected item
4. WHEN harvesting encounters account-specific errors THEN system SHALL continue processing other accounts and report issues clearly
5. WHEN organizing collected evidence THEN system SHALL allow filtering and sorting by source account

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a self-represented litigant, I want my additional email account connections to be secure and private, so that I can trust the system with sensitive legal communications from multiple sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user connects additional accounts THEN system SHALL use OAuth2 flow with minimal required permissions
2. WHEN storing connection credentials THEN system SHALL encrypt all tokens and sensitive data
3. WHEN accessing connected accounts THEN system SHALL respect user-defined access limitations and timeframes
4. WHEN user data policy changes THEN system SHALL require re-authorization for continued access
5. IF security breach detected THEN system SHALL automatically revoke all connected account access

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Email connection management isolated from authentication and email harvesting logic
- **Modular Design**: Reusable OAuth service for connecting any Google account type (Gmail, Workspace)
- **Dependency Management**: Email connections module independent of specific email processing logic
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined API for managing multiple account connections

### Performance
- OAuth flows must complete within 30 seconds under normal network conditions
- Account connection status checks must return within 2 seconds
- Multiple account harvesting must provide real-time progress indicators
- System must handle up to 10 connected accounts per user without performance degradation

### Security
- All OAuth tokens encrypted at rest using application encryption keys
- Token refresh handled automatically with secure storage of refresh tokens
- Account connections isolated per user with no cross-user access
- Audit logging of all account connection and disconnection events
- Automatic token revocation on user account deletion

### Reliability
- Graceful handling of expired or revoked OAuth tokens
- Retry logic for temporary API failures during account operations
- Clear error reporting without exposing sensitive authentication details
- Fallback mechanisms when account connections become unavailable
- Data integrity maintained even when some connected accounts are inaccessible

### Usability
- Clear visual indicators for account connection status (connected, expired, error)
- Intuitive account management interface requiring no technical knowledge
- Helpful tooltips and guidance throughout the connection process
- Mobile-responsive design for account management on all devices
- Consistent terminology aligned with Google's account management language
