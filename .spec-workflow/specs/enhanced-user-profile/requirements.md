# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature expands the user profile system to collect comprehensive personal information needed for legal proceedings, including detailed user personal data with historical address tracking, spouse information, and children information. This enhanced profile enables the litigation support system to generate complete, accurate legal documents and provides a centralized repository of family and personal information commonly required in legal cases, particularly family law matters where address changes are common.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports our core mission of empowering self-represented litigants by:
- **Reducing Legal Inequality**: Providing structured data collection that matches professional legal forms and requirements
- **Improving Case Outcomes**: Ensuring all necessary personal and family information is captured accurately and completely with historical context
- **Democratizing Legal Tools**: Making complex family and personal data management accessible to pro se litigants
- **Privacy-First Design**: Maintaining complete user control over sensitive family and personal information
- **Lowering Barriers to Justice**: Simplifying the process of gathering and organizing personal information needed for legal proceedings

5. WHEN child residence changes THEN the system SHALL track who they live with and effective dates
6. WHEN child gender is specified THEN the system SHALL provide inclusive gender options
7. WHEN multiple children exist THEN the system SHALL allow adding, editing, and removing individual child records
8. WHEN child residence history is viewed THEN the system SHALL show chronological living arrangements
9. IF a child's information is incomplete THEN the system SHALL indicate which fields require completion

### Requirement 4: Marriage Information Documentation

**User Story:** As a self-represented litigant in family legal proceedings, I want to record marriage-related information including marriage date, location, and current status, so that I have complete marital history documentation for legal cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user indicates they are/were married THEN the system SHALL display marriage information fields
2. WHEN marriage date is entered THEN the system SHALL validate the date format and logical constraints
3. WHEN marriage location is provided THEN the system SHALL accept city, state, and country information
4. WHEN marriage status is updated THEN the system SHALL track status changes with timestamps
5. IF marriage information affects other profile sections THEN the system SHALL update related fields accordingly

### Requirement 5: Address and Residence Data Management

**User Story:** As a self-represented litigant, I want the system to efficiently manage address and residence changes for all family members, so that I can easily track and reference historical living arrangements that may be relevant to my legal case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any address is added THEN the system SHALL require start date and allow optional end date
2. WHEN an address is marked as current THEN the system SHALL ensure only one current address exists per person
3. WHEN address date ranges overlap THEN the system SHALL validate and prevent conflicts
4. WHEN viewing address history THEN the system SHALL provide timeline visualization of residence changes
5. WHEN exporting profile data THEN the system SHALL include complete address histories with date ranges
6. IF address data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate missing effective dates or address details

### Requirement 6: Data Validation and Integrity

**User Story:** As a self-represented litigant, I want the system to validate my profile information and ensure data consistency across all addresses and family member information, so that I can trust the accuracy of information used in legal documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any profile data is entered THEN the system SHALL perform real-time validation
2. WHEN date fields are completed THEN the system SHALL ensure logical consistency (marriage before children, realistic ages, address date ranges)
