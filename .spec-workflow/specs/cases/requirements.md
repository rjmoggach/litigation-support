# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cases app enables self-represented litigants to systematically manage their Ontario family court cases through a structured hierarchy of case profiles, court events, associated documents, service tracking, and comprehensive case notes. This comprehensive case management system provides organized storage with date-prefixed document naming conventions, dual-format storage supporting both original files and smart text content, complete document service lifecycle tracking, and rich note-taking capabilities for future document intelligence features.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product's mission to "democratize legal tools" by providing self-represented litigants with professional-level case management capabilities typically only available to law firms. It aligns with the vision of "empowering self-represented litigants who cannot afford professional legal representation" by offering structured organization of complex family court proceedings, comprehensive service tracking for legal compliance, and detailed case notes for strategic planning, ensuring users can "navigate complex legal proceedings with confidence" through systematic case tracking, detailed case profiles, intelligent document management, and complete service audit trails.
