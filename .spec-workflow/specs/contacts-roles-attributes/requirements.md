# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Contacts Roles and Attributes system extends the existing contacts module to support legal case management by adding role-based categorization, case associations, and multiple contact methods. This feature enables self-represented litigants to organize their contacts based on legal relationships (opposition, counsel, court personnel) and maintain comprehensive communication records throughout their case.

This system provides a structured way to differentiate between "My Record" (the user), "Ex-Spouse" (opposing party), "My Counsel" (legal representation), and other essential legal relationships, while supporting multiple phone numbers and email addresses for thorough communication tracking.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the core product mission of "democratizing access to sophisticated evidence management tools" by providing professional-level contact organization capabilities typically only available to law firms. It empowers self-represented litigants to:

- **Organize Legal Relationships**: Clear categorization of all parties involved in their case
- **Track Communication Channels**: Multiple contact methods for comprehensive correspondence records
- **Maintain Professional Standards**: Structured approach to case participant management
- **Improve Case Outcomes**: Better organization leads to more effective legal proceedings
